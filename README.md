# GIFKit

A pure-Swift library decoding your friend and mine, the humble GIF. I've never written this kind of file parser before, so this is an experiment for learning purposes.

**Besides the fact it's a work in progress and doesn't actually work at all yet, I would strongly recommend not using this for anything since it's not used in a production app. You should use the methods code in UIKit/CoreGraphics/ImageIO, you've been warned!**
