# GIFKit

A pure-Swift library for working with your friend and mine, the humble GIF. I've never written this kind of file parser before, so this is an experiment for learning purposes. I'm focusing on decoding GIFs at first, and may get to encoding eventually.

**Besides the fact it's a work in progress and doesn't actually work at all yet, I would strongly recommend not using this for anything since it's not used in a production app. You should use the methods code in UIKit/CoreGraphics/ImageIO, you've been warned!**
